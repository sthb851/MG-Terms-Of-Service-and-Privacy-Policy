# 🐰 Alice System (Nikke Co-op Bot) – Terms of Service

Thank you for using the **Alice System** (formerly Nikke Co-op Bot)! I am designed to assist *Goddess of Victory: Nikke* Commanders with co-op matchmaking, union management, and strategic advice. By inviting me to your server, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. 🎯 Purpose of the System

The Alice System is a multi-purpose assistant created to help Commanders:
*   **Find Teammates:** Quickly form co-op teams based on server regions.
*   **Manage Unions:** Organize raids, track damage, and compare union performance.
*   **Get Strategy:** Ask `@Alice` for advice on Nikkes, teams, and bosses (powered by AI).

---

## 2. 👥 User Eligibility

*   You must be **13 years or older** to use this bot, in accordance with Discord’s Terms of Service.
*   All users must comply with the rules of the Discord server where the bot is used.
*   Admins must properly configure the bot using `/co_op_setup` or `/set_channel` before use.

---

## 3. 🔐 Data Collection & Privacy

I only store **minimal, non-sensitive** information needed to do my job:
*   **Discord User IDs** (for cooldowns, session tracking, and damage records).
*   **Role IDs** (for region pings).
*   **Channel and Message IDs** (for interactive boards).
*   **Union Data** (damage logs provided by users).

**I do NOT collect private messages, login credentials, or sensitive personal data.**
*See the full Privacy Policy for details on AI data usage.*

---

## 4. 🚫 Fair Use & Abuse Policy

To ensure a positive experience for all Commanders:
*   Do **not** abuse the ping system or attempt to bypass cooldown timers.
*   Do **not** spam `@Alice` with inappropriate or malicious queries.
*   Misuse may result in:
    *   Temporary or permanent restrictions.
    *   Being blocked from using the system.

---

## 5. 🛡️ Anti-Spam Protection

I have a built-in anti-spam system to protect server resources:
*   **Co-Op Spam:** Using `/co_op` **5 times in 5 minutes** triggers a timeout (6h -> 24h -> 48h).
*   **AI Spam:** Excessive rapid mentions of `@Alice` may trigger a temporary ignore period.
*   **Goal:** Keep the system fast and responsive for everyone!

---

## 6. 🔄 Updates & Changes

I am constantly evolving! New features (like better AI or new raid tools) may be added. Continued usage implies acceptance of these terms. Major updates will be announced in the official support server.
