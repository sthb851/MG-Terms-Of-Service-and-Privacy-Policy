# 🤖 Nikke Co-op Bot – Terms of Service.

Thank you for using the **Nikke Co-op Bot**, a Discord bot designed to streamline matchmaking for *Goddess of Victory: Nikke* players. By using this bot in your server, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. 🎯 Purpose of the Bot.

Nikke Co-op is a community-driven matchmaking bot created to help players quickly form co-op teams based on their server regions. The bot enables users to:

* Set up dedicated co-op channels.
* Configure and manage region-based roles (NA, Global, Japan, SEA, Korea).
* Use role pings with smart cooldowns to prevent spam.
* Automatically create team boards with up to 5 player slots.
* Join or leave teams using interactive buttons.
* Launch additional co-op groups if needed.

---

## 2. 👥 User Eligibility.

* You must be **13 years or older** to use this bot, in accordance with Discord’s Terms of Service.
* All users must comply with the rules of the Discord server where the bot is used.
* Admins must properly configure the bot using `/co_op_setup` before use.

---

## 3. 🔐 Data Collection & Privacy.

The bot only stores **minimal, non-sensitive** information needed for functionality, including:

* Discord User IDs (for cooldowns and sessions).
* Role IDs (for region pings).
* Channel and Message IDs (for visual team boards).

**No private messages, login credentials, or sensitive personal data are collected, stored, or shared.**

---

## 4. 🚫 Fair Use & Abuse Policy.

To ensure a positive experience for all users:

* Do **not** abuse the ping system or attempt to bypass the cooldown timers (2 hours per region).
* Misuse, spamming, or trolling may result in:

  * Temporary or permanent cooldown restrictions.
  * Removal of roles.
  * Being blocked from using the bot.

Server admins are encouraged to monitor bot usage and report repeated abuse.


---

## 5. 🛡️ Anti-Spam Protection

A new anti-spam system to the Co-Op bot to stop command abuse and protect server resources (especially since we’re on Railway). 

**Here’s how it works:**

* If someone uses `/co_op` **5 times in 5 minutes**, the bot sees it as spam and applies a timeout.
* **Timeouts increase with repeated abuse**:

  * 1st: 6 hours
  * 2nd: 24 hours
  * 3rd: 48 hours

**Important notes:**

* Normal users won’t be affected unless they spam.
* Admins **aren’t exempt**  it’s fair for everyone. 
* It only tracks the `/co_op` command (not buttons).
* Works alongside the region cooldown system.
* Automatically resets old data and gives helpful tips when needed.

**Goal:**
To keep things smooth for legit users while blocking spammers automatically.

## 11.  📜 Required Bot Permissions.

To ensure proper functionality across all servers, the NIKKE-CO-OP bot requires the following permissions. These are essential for core features like co-op session creation, chart displays, interaction buttons, and modlog updates.


#### **Core Messaging Permissions**

* ✅ **View Channel** — Allows the bot to see channels and their messages.
* ✅ **Send Messages** — Enables the bot to post co-op sessions, updates, and interactions.
* ✅ **Send Messages in Threads** — Supports threaded conversations and organized discussions.
* ✅ **Embed Links** — Required for displaying rich embed content (e.g., co-op sessions, updates).
* ✅ **Attach Files** — Needed for sharing generated images such as charts.


#### **Thread Management**

* ✅ **Create Public Threads** — Organizes session discussions publicly.
* ✅ **Create Private Threads** — Supports private or team-specific coordination.
* ✅ **Manage Threads** — Lets the bot maintain and clean up thread activity.


#### **Moderation**

* ✅ **Manage Messages** — Allows the bot to clean up messages (if necessary).

These permissions are vital for:

* Co-op session creation and real-time updates.
* Embedded damage charts and interactive join/leave buttons.
