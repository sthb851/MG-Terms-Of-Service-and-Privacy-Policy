## 8.  `/modlog` Command!

The bot has been updated to support a new `/modlog` command. Once this command is configured in a server, the bot will **automatically send all future update announcements** to the selected channel whenever a new update is released.

:lock: **Important Note for Private Channels:**
If the modlog channel is private (e.g. staff-only or admin logs), server admins must **manually give the bot's role access** to that channel and ensure the following **permissions are enabled**:

:white_check_mark: View Channel
:white_check_mark: Send Messages
:white_check_mark: Send Messages in Threads
:white_check_mark: Create Public Threads
:white_check_mark: Create Private Threads
:white_check_mark: Manage Messages
:white_check_mark: Manage Threads
:white_check_mark: Embed Links
:white_check_mark: Attach Files
:white_check_mark: Read Message History

This ensures the bot can deliver update messages properly in your server.
