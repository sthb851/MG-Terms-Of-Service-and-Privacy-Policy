## 10.  📜 Required Bot Permissions

To ensure proper functionality across all servers, the NIKKE-CO-OP bot requires the following permissions. These are essential for core features like co-op session creation, chart displays, interaction buttons, and modlog updates.


#### **Core Messaging Permissions**

* ✅ **View Channel** — Allows the bot to see channels and their messages
* ✅ **Send Messages** — Enables the bot to post co-op sessions, updates, and interactions
* ✅ **Send Messages in Threads** — Supports threaded conversations and organized discussions
* ✅ **Embed Links** — Required for displaying rich embed content (e.g., co-op sessions, updates)
* ✅ **Attach Files** — Needed for sharing generated images such as charts


#### **Thread Management**

* ✅ **Create Public Threads** — Organizes session discussions publicly
* ✅ **Create Private Threads** — Supports private or team-specific coordination
* ✅ **Manage Threads** — Lets the bot maintain and clean up thread activity


#### **Moderation**

* ✅ **Manage Messages** — Allows the bot to clean up messages (if necessary)
* ✅ **Read Message History** — Ensures the bot can access past messages for buttons, logs, or persistent updates


These permissions are vital for:

* Co-op session creation and real-time updates
* Embedded damage charts and interactive join/leave buttons
* Server-wide update announcements using `/modlog`
* Smooth and visually consistent user experience

If the modlog channel is private, server admins **must manually add the bot’s role** to the channel and **grant these permissions** to ensure all updates are delivered correctly.
