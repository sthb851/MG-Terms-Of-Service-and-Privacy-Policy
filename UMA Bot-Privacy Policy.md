# 🔒 Privacy Policy – UMA Bot

*Last updated: August 2025 🗓️*

## 1. Data We Collect 📝

MG-UMA Bot (“the Bot”) collects and stores only the following information necessary for its functionality:

* **🆔 Discord User ID** – to identify users uniquely
* **💬 Discord Username** – for display purposes
* **📊 Submitted Scores** – up to the last 3 per user per competition type

The Bot does **not** collect any other personal data such as emails, passwords, or payment information ❌.

---

## 2. How Data is Used ⚙️

The collected data is used exclusively to:

* 🏆 Track and display your Mini Cup scores
* 📈 Generate performance cards and leaderboards
* 👥 Allow server admins and players to access and compare scores

When a 4th score is submitted, the oldest score is **automatically deleted** 🗑️. This means the Bot always keeps **only 3 scores per user** at any time.

## 3. Data Storage & Security 🔐

* 💾 Data is stored securely on the hosting environment used by the Bot owner
* 🚫 No data is shared, sold, or transferred to third parties
* 🛡️ The Bot owner takes reasonable steps to protect data from unauthorized access

## 4. Data Retention ⏳

* Scores are kept until replaced by newer entries (always maximum of 3 per user)
* If you leave the server or stop using the Bot, your data may still be stored unless explicitly removed

---

## 5. User Rights ✨

You have the right to:

* 🗑️ Request deletion of your data (Discord ID, username, and scores)
* 🛑 Stop using the Bot at any time (this halts further data collection)

Deletion requests can be made by contacting the Bot owner.
