UMA Bot enforces a strict policy against submitting false or manipulated scores to maintain fair competition and leaderboard integrity. By using UMA Bot, you agree to abide by the following rules and consequences.

#### 3.1 Prohibited Actions

The following actions are considered violations of our Terms of Service:

* Submitting artificially inflated scores
* Submitting scores with suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated digits such as `9999`)
* Submitting unrealistically high scores (typically 5+ digits)
* Attempting to manipulate the leaderboard system
* Excessive command usage (rate limit: 5 uses of the same command within 1 minute)

#### 3.2 Detection System

Our system automatically flags suspicious score submissions, including:

* Scores with 5 or more digits
* Scores with 4 or more identical digits in sequence
* Scores with obvious patterns (sequential or alternating)
* Any score that appears statistically improbable

:warning: Flagged submissions are subject to administrator review before being accepted or denied.

Violations of our Terms of Service will result in the following:

#### 3.5 Appeals Process

If you believe a restriction was applied in error, you may appeal by:

* Contacting a server administrator via DM
