# 🔒 Nikke Co-op Bot – Privacy Policy

Thank you for using the **Nikke Co-op Bot**. This Privacy Policy explains how the bot handles user data and ensures compliance with Discord’s Developer Terms of Service, community guidelines, and best practices.

---

## 1. 📊 Data We Collect

The Nikke Co-op Bot only collects **minimal, non-sensitive information** required for functionality:

* **Discord User IDs** – Used for co-op cooldown tracking and team session management.
* **Role IDs** – Used to assign and ping region-based roles (NA, Global, Japan, SEA, Korea).
* **Channel & Message IDs** – Used to display team boards, manage interactions, and send modlog updates.

👉 **We do not collect or store private messages, emails, passwords, or any sensitive personal data.**

---

## 2. 🗄️ Data Storage

* Data is stored **temporarily** and only for the purpose of bot features (e.g., cooldowns, team boards, reports).
* Old or unused data is automatically **reset or deleted** to prevent unnecessary storage.
* No data is shared, sold, or used outside the bot’s intended purpose.

---

## 3. 📤 Data Sharing

The bot **does not share your data** with third parties.
Data may only be shared if required by:

* Discord (to comply with their API rules)
* Legal obligations (rare, but if requested by law)

Otherwise, all user and server data stays private.

---

## 4. 🔐 User Control

You have the right to:

* Request deletion of your data (contact the developer via the support server).
* Stop using the bot at any time, which ends all future data collection.
* Remove the bot from your server if you no longer want it to function.

---

## 5. 🛡️ Security

* Only essential IDs are stored — no sensitive data.
* Data is protected using Railway’s built-in security and database management.
* Abuse prevention systems (like cooldowns and anti-spam) are handled with **temporary identifiers** that reset automatically.

---

## 6. 🔄 Updates

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the bot introduces new features or if Discord changes its requirements. Major updates will be announced in the **official support server**.

---

## 7. 📞 Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your data:

➡️ Join the **Official Support Server**: [https://discord.gg/QsKByDNdxt](https://discord.gg/QsKByDNdxt)
➡️ Contact the developer: **Professor\_Ashe**

Would you like me to make this **short & Discord-style (like your TOS)** with emojis and bullet points (so it looks like a proper bot doc), or keep it **more legal-style** for formality?
