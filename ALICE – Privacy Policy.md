# 🔒 Alice System – Privacy Policy

Thank you for using the **Alice System** (Nikke Co-op Bot). This Privacy Policy explains how I handle your data to ensure transparency and trust.

---

## 1. 📊 Data We Collect

I collect only the **minimal** information needed to function:

*   **Discord User IDs** – To track cooldowns, manage sessions, and remember your last AI topic (e.g., "talking about Red Hood").
*   **Role IDs** – To handle region pings (NA, Global, etc.).
*   **Channel & Message IDs** – To manage interactive boards and clean up messages.
*   **Union Data** – Damage logs you explicitly upload via `/set_blog` for analysis.
*   **AI Interactions** – When you mention `@Alice`, your message text is processed to generate a response.

👉 **I do NOT collect or store private messages, emails, passwords, or any sensitive personal data.**

## 2. 🗄️ Data Storage

*   **Temporary Data:** Most data (like cooldowns and AI conversation context) is stored in temporary memory and resets if the bot restarts.
*   **Persistent Data:** Union damage logs and server settings are stored in a secure database hosted on **Railway**.
*   **AI Data:** Your questions to `@Alice` are processed in real-time. We do not permanently archive your chat history.

---

## 3. 📤 Data Sharing & Third Parties

I do not sell your data. However, to provide my services, I interact with these trusted third-party providers:

*   **Discord:** To send and receive messages (standard bot functionality).
*   **Railway:** Hosting provider where the bot and database live.
*   **Hugging Face (Llama-3.2-3B):** The primary AI model for Alice's personality and general chat. Your queries are processed by the Llama-3.2-3B model.
*   **Google (Gemini AI):** Used for supplementary reasoning and web search analysis.
    *   *Note: Providers may retain data for a limited time to improve their services, subject to their own Privacy Policies.*

## 4. 🔐 User Control

You have the right to:
*   **Request Deletion:** Ask to have your union data removed.
*   **Opt-Out:** Stop using the bot or kick it from your server.
*   **Clear History:** The `/db_save` command is for admins, but you can request a manual data wipe via the support server.

---

## 5. 🛡️ Security

*   Only essential IDs are stored.
*   Database access is restricted and secured via Railway.
*   AI processing is transient; we don't build profiles on individual users.
