# Privacy Policy – MG-UMA Bot

*Last updated: August 2025*

## 1. Data We Collect

MG-UMA Bot (“the Bot”) collects and stores only the following information necessary for its functionality:

* **Discord User ID** (to identify users uniquely)
* **Discord Username** (for display purposes)
* **Submitted Scores** (up to the last 3 per user per competition type)

The Bot does **not** collect any other personal data such as emails, passwords, or payment information.

---

## 2. How Data is Used

The collected data is used exclusively to:

* Track and display your Mini Cup scores
* Generate performance cards and leaderboards
* Allow server admins and players to access and compare scores

When a 4th score is submitted, the oldest score is **automatically deleted**. This means the Bot always keeps **only 3 scores per user** at any time.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Security

* Data is stored securely on the hosting environment used by the Bot owner.
* No data is shared, sold, or transferred to third parties.
* The Bot owner takes reasonable steps to protect data from unauthorized access.

---

## 4. Data Retention

* Scores are kept until replaced by newer entries (always maximum of 3 per user).
* If you leave the server or stop using the Bot, your data may still be stored unless explicitly removed.

---

## 5. User Rights

You have the right to:

* Request deletion of your data (Discord ID, username, and scores)
* Stop using the Bot at any time (this halts further data collection)

Deletion requests can be made by contacting the Bot owner.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

In compliance with **Discord’s Terms of Service**, this Bot may only be used by users aged **13 years and older**.
